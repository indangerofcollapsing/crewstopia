A utility to compile, decompile, add to, and remove from Bioware's HAK format, as used for the game NeverWinter Nights. The
source code is included for your use or for a good laugh at my expense, see LICENSE for details.

Command line
------------

hakedit [-h|v|S] [<hak> [-a|d <file>] [-u|p <dir>] [-o] [-s]]

-h Display help and exit
-v Display version and (c) info
-S Support HAKedit and MetaHAK development via PayPal donation (opens browser)

-a add <file> to <hak>
-d delete <file> from <hak>

-u unpack <hak> to <dir>
-p create <hak> from files in <dir>

-o overwrite existing files in <dir> (valid with -u and -a only)
-s suppress description.txt handling (valid with -u only)
-q quiet mode - suppresses most messages


Operation
---------

Fairly straightforward. If you use -a or -d, hakedit creates a temp dir on the root of your current drive, but deletes this
when finished. With -u, a file named "description.txt" will be unpacked containing the HAK's name, URL, and description
fields, unless you use the -s switch. With -p, if there is a file called "description.txt", hakedit wil put the contents in
those fields instead of packingthe file normally. Any files which I don't have a Bioware type code for will be ignored. I
think I have all of them, but let me know if I don't :) When you use -a or -d, the HAK is changed in place, so a backup
copy would be prudent


Examples
--------

1) Unpacking a HAK to get at the files in it

hakedit myhak.hak -u mydir

2) Packing a HAK from a directory containing Bioware resource files

hakedit myhak.hak -p mydir

3) Deleting a file from a HAK

hakedit myhak.hak -d myfile.tga

3) Adding a file to a HAK

hakedit myhak.hak -a myfile.tga

4) Updating a file in a hak to a new version

hakedit myhak.hak -u mydir
copy myfile.tga mydir
hakedit myhak.hak -p mydir

5) Combining two HAKs, files from the first overriding the second

hakedit myhak1.hak -u mydir
hakedit myhak2.hak -u mydir
hakedit myhak3.hak -d mydir

6) Combining two HAKs, files from the second overriding the first

hakedit myhak1.hak -u mydir
hakedit myhak2.hak -u mydir -o
hakedit myhak3.hak -d mydir

* Bioware for creating Neverwinter Nights in the first place, also for their mostly non-obfuscated file formats :D

* Rothos for releasing hid HAKCombine faster than I could get hakedit out, giving me some lead time on confirming that my
format analysis was essentially correct, and giving people a chance to find one error that slipped through.
