NeverWinter Nights TLK Editor V1.1
----------------------------------

This utility will help you to edit the dialog.tlk file
which contains the texts can be found in the game. You
can create new texts or you can modify the existing ones
with this utility. For example: you can add new spell names,
spell descriptions, etc.

New Features in version 1.1
---------------------------

- you are able to delete the last few entries from the tlk file
- you can add new entries by specifying the entry number exactly
  and if the specified entry number is higher than the current
  maximum entries then it automaticaly builds up the database to
  reach that entry number. For example: there are 65000 entries
  in the tlk file and you press the New... button and enter
  80000 as entry number then the TLK Editor creates 14999 empty
  entries so you can add entry 80000 easily.
- new entry bug corrected: now the completely new entries show up
  in NWN correctly
