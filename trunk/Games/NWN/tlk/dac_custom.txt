Practised Shifter

49996
You are well versed in Shifting.  You gain a +4 bonus to your character level when attempting to take the form of another creature.
This does not affect your effective Shifter level, only your effective character level.  So as a Level 1 PnP Shifter, you cannot take any forms other than medium or small humanoid, but you can take the form of a higher Challenge Rating humanoid than you otherwise would be able.
